        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>My name is Precious Kamau</p>
        <h3>Journey to Software Enginnering</h3>
        <p>
            From computer studies in high school to my father being a tech wizard, it makes sense that when opportunity strikes he would jump for it.I began the journey into software engineering to keep myself busy before university started and here I am now.
        </p>
        <h3>My Goals</h3>
        <p>
            1. I want to be a top tier digital forensic expert.
        </p>
        <p>Challenges are my thing and solving them gives me a kick an adrenaline junkie craves for always.</p>       
        <p>2. Start an animal shelter. </p>
        <p>Animals are my soft spot and I would love to give them a home and a family to love them.</p>
        <p>3. Be financially independent as early as possible and be filthy rich</p>
        <p>Cause why not?</p>

        <h3>Little story about my roots</h3>
        <p>
            Since I was a little mushroom, society saw it fit that kids should follow the path of their parents.
            With a father who was a computer science professor, it was only natural that I would follow in his footsteps.
            It was alright, gadgets were exciting. My heart was'nt content though as criminology spoke to me. A passion I always had.
            It was  a hard decision to make. Parents or passion, I wondered. How could I make them happy and still be happy too?
            It was two bulls in the same pen. One had to dominate the other. It took awhile but I found a way.What if we met somewhere in the middle?
            So for both sides a compromise was made. Cybersecurity.After researching on it, I found it mesmerising.
            Computers were my thing. My high school certificate was a testament to that with a straight A.
            I found something that spoke for me and I loved it. Software engineering came up as a way to keep busy till university started.
            And it grew on me so here we are today. All it needed was a little push from both sides.
